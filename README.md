# dotfiles
A collection of various configuration files I have written. Config files are organized by program, with the most recent configuration (that I am using) appropriately named. For example, "dotfiles/tmux/.tmux.conf" is my latest tmux configuration.

### /tmux
My current tmux configuration has the hostname in the bottom left status bar. The right status bar shows the IP address of the machine and also the date/time.
